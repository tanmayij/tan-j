I also dwell wherever poetry and literature are. I have a published anthology, called Eternities Spent in Contemplation, and two blogs on [WordPress](https://tanmayatvam.wordpress.com), and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/whatamibutpaper/)(for more visual content), where I try to combine poetry with everything else. I'm also a regular practitioner of Yoga and Kathak (an Indian classical dance form). I am on a constant quest to understand and overlap humanities with technology and law.

I Volunteer as a Mental Health Team member for Peer Health Education at the University of Waterloo.
